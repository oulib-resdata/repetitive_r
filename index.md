*Repetitive Tasks in R*

This workshop is an active learning "code-along" overview of how to automate repetitive tasks while programming in R. This is an expansion and extension of the R function and loop materials presented in Software Carpentry [https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/].

After this workshop, you should know when and how to

- use loops to automate tasks
- use vectorized base or package functions to automate tasks
- write your own functions to automate tasks

Please bring a computer with R (required) and RStudio (suggested) installed. Prior experience coding in R is required. I.e., most of the code in chapters 1-6 in Software Carpentry with R [https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/] should be familiar to you. Complete novices to R should attend Data or Software Carpentry instead [libraries.ou.edu/carpentries].

This is an intermediate-level workshop for researchers presented by University Libraries [libraries.ou.edu] to improve research efficiency with new tools and workflows.



> ## Prerequisites
>
> Understand that computers store data and instructions (programs, scripts etc.) in files.
> Files are organised in directories (folders).
> Know how to access files not in the working directory by specifying the path.
