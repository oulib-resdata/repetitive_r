```{r, include=FALSE}

```

Most of R's functions are vectorized, meaning that the function will
operate on all elements of a vector without needing to loop through
and act on each element one at a time. This makes writing code more
concise, easy to read, and less error prone.


```{r}
x <- 1:4
x * 2
```

The multiplication happened to each element of the vector.

We can also add two vectors together:

```{r}
y <- 6:9
x + y
```

Each element of `x` was added to its corresponding element of `y`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x:  1  2  3  4
    +  +  +  +
y:  6  7  8  9
---------------
    7  9 11 13
```

Comparison operators, logical operators, and many functions are also
vectorized:


**Comparison operators**

```{r}
x > 2
```

**Logical operators**
```{r}
a <- x > 3  # or, for clarity, a <- (x > 3)
a
```

> ## Tip: some useful functions for logical vectors
>
> `any()` will return `TRUE` if *any* element of a vector is `TRUE`.  
> `all()` will return `TRUE` if *all* elements of a vector are `TRUE`.


Most functions also operate element-wise on vectors:

**Functions**
```{r}
x <- 1:4
log(x)
```



** The lapply function **
lapply() takes a function, applies it to each element in a list, and returns the results in the form of a list.
If you've taken Software Carpentry with R, you may recall that a data frame is actually a special case of a list where all the list items are vectors of the same length.  

** What class is each column? **
```{r}
unlist(lapply(mtcars, class))
```

** Divide each column by the mean **
```{r}
mtcars[] <- lapply(mtcars, function(x) x / mean(x))
```


> ## Challenge 2
>
> Duplicate the code above (to divide each column by the mean) using a `for` loop.

> > ## Solution to challenge 2
> >
```{r}
for(i in 1:length(mtcars)){
  mtcars[[i]]/mean(unlist(mtcars))
}
```


The functions map() and lapply() work to take input (elements of a list, such as columns of a dataframe, apply a function f() to them, and provide output back [a list, in the case of lapply()].
