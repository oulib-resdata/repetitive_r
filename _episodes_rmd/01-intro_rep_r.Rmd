```{r, include=FALSE}
source("../bin/chunk-options.R")
knitr_fig_path("07-")
# Silently load in the data so the rest of the lesson works
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv", header=TRUE)
# Silently set seed for random number generation, so we don't have to explain it
set.seed(10)
```

## When would I need to perform repetitive tasks?
Loading multiple data files, repeating an operation (for example descriptive statistics) in different groups or by different conditions, or generating a sequence.

## What are the different ways you can repeat tasks in R?
Loops, elseif, vectorized, functions.

## When should you use each case?
Elseif sorts - do something if a case is met.
Loops go through many items.  R is vectorized which means most looping, such as going through rows of a database, can be performed by applying a function to a column by itself with no further work.
Functions - writing your own function can help with complex loops.
Loops and vectorized operations are similar at small-moderate sized datasets, but in larger datasets vectorizations should be faster.  Sequences require a loop.  Otherwise, you can use lapply, tapply, or sapply.
